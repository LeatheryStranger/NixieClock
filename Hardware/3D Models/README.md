# STL Files

These Files should allow you to print your own enclosure.  I printed mine on a Formlabs Form 2, so I've not tested their printability with any FDM printers YRMV.

| Part Name | Description | Comments |
| FrontFacade | Faceplate and Mount for NixieSocketHolder | M3 tap for mounting holes, Glue to LeftWall/RightWall/Top |
| LeftWall | Sidewall for Enclosure, includes hole for ON/OFF switch | M3 tap for mounting holes |
| RightWall | Sidewall for Enclosure | M3 tap for mounting holes |
| NixieSocketHolder |  mount for IN-12 sockets | Mounting holes should fit M3, need to drill and tap holes to mount sockets, guess what? I used M3 |
|LeftBackWall | Back and Bottom, includes mounting holes for LeftWall/RightWall, and hole for DC power socket (see BoM) | Need to drill out holes (wrong size for M3 mounting screws |
|RightBackWall | Back and Bottom, includes mounting holes for LeftWall/RightWall, and hole for DC power socket (see BoM) | Need to drill out holes (wrong size for M3 mounting screws |
| Top | Grill for top | Glue to LeftWall/RightWall to make an arch, BONDIC works great |
