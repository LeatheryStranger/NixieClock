# NixieClock
Yet another Nixie Clock build
I got enamored with Nixie tubes as, it seems, every other tinkerer has these days.  COVID-19 finally pushed me to start on this project, as I figured I should at least learn something during this strange time.  This repository contains everything you need to create a simple Nixie Clock that will keep time in one timezone without worrying about daylight savings.
